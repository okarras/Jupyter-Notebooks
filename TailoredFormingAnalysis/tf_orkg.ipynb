    "## Analysis of the Tailored Forming Process Chain for the Manufacturing of Hybrid Components\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains several analyses of scholarly knowledge from scientific publications on the topic of *[Tailored Forming Process Chain for the Manufacturing of Hybrid Components with Bearing Raceways Using Different Material Combinations](https://orkg.org/comparison/R187049/)* from the research field *Mechanical Process Engineering*. These analyses are based on domain-specific competency questions about the described scholarly knowledge posed by domain experts in this research area. While the individual competency questions are presented below for overview, their details are explained in the respective section of this Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competency questions:\n",
    "1. [How often are certain qualities of hybrid components examined in the individual steps of the Tailored Forming process chain?](#q1)\n",
    "2. [Which material combinations are used for the manufacturing of hybrid components?](#q2)\n",
    "3. [How do the steps of the Tailored Forming process chain affect the hardness of the cladding layer of hybrid components?](#q3)\n",
    "4. [In which material combinations and steps of the Tailored Forming process chain can defects occur in hybrid components?](#q4)\n",
    "5. [What service lives can be achieved for hybrid components depending on the material combinations?](#q5)\n",
    "6. [Which manufacturing methods are used in the individual steps of the Tailored Forming process chain to manufacture the respective hybrid component?](#q6)\n",
    "7. [How often are certain manufacturing methods used in total in all described Tailored Forming process chains?](#q7)\n",
    "8. [Which microstructures are present in hybrid components after the steps of the Tailored Forming process chain?](#q8)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the description of the scholarly knowledge from such publications in this research field, we developed a [ORKG template](https://www.orkg.org/orkg/template/R150595) to consistently describe a Tailored Forming process chain for the manufacturing hybrid components. An [ORKG template](https://www.orkg.org/orkg/about/19/Templates) defines a semantic structure for consistently describing research contributions of different scientific publications so that the contributions described contain the same information in the same structure to make the publications comparable.\n",
    "This description includes the entire process chain with its steps, source materials, and resulting components with their qualities. The template makes it possible to describe each step of a process chain in terms of its sequence in the process chain, its input, its manufacturing method used, and its output with the examined qualities, their associated measurement methods, and measurement results."
