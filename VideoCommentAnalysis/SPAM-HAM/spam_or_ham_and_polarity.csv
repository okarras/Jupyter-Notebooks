If you look at I-290 heading into downtown Chicago there is literally no room to expand the highway - each side has access roads and houses making expansion impossible. 
An elevated highway might be cheaper to build but would likely be more expensive to maintain - especially during the winter. Some kind of steam heating built underneath the road would be needed to stop snow accumulation.

doing more harm to Our Planet and Atmosphere than you may think; with his revolutionary ideas. He is nothing but a South African Foreign Immigrant Boy Genius, that made his way into the USA through Canada, then by way of California. EL ON steals Our Tax Dollars by way of Grant Money from Our Own USA Government, which should go to USA Native Geniuses. No, instead Our Own USA Government gives this False Icon known as EL ON Musk the financial backing to pollute Our Earth with his Lithium Batteries and pollute Our Atmosphere with his Rockets and much other Space Debris. Now he plans to pollute Our Atmosphere even more with his Starlink Enterprise, which will cause a number of collisions with other Satellites in Space, causing more Space Junk and more Collisions. Who gave this EL ON a pass to pollute Our World and Atmosphere? The USA / State Government? News Flash, the Governments are there to Serve The People and We pay Our Taxes so the Governments can give EL ON more Grants and State Incentives to pollute Our World and Atmosphere. ¬†This EL ON is an imposter sent to drain and deplete Our Planet and he is helping the Droconians find a new home in the next Planet over, Mars, so that they may Industrialize Mars too. Don't believe his hype. He only develops prototypes for his projects or Low Scale Developments of his ideas to a Minimum Point, so it is enough to get Investors and Grant Money. Or just to get Future Seekers, like me, following this Imposter. Our Future Generations are going to pay for the mess that EL ON has made here. By the way, if you think the ""Boring Company,"" is just another cute little name EL ON came up with; NO, the word ""Bor,"" means ""Drill,"" in the Dutch Language. That is exactly what the ""Boring Company,"" is doing; ""Drilling."" Under the Major Cities of the USA. There is something else going On here with EL ON. EL ON is from South Africa, but We All know the Dutch Settled in South Africa and created a Mass Apartiehd System, of Segregation, Hate, and Genocide on the Darker Peoples of South Africa. ¬†The Dutch created one of the most Ruthless and Shameful Acts of Racism in Our Most Recent History. That same Dutch Mentality and Blood is in the Vessels of this Boy Genius, EL ON, that Everyone is praising today. The USA Government allows a Dutch / South African / Canadian / USA Alien Foreign Immigrant to come to Our Country and dig up under the streets in Our Major Cities in the name of getting from Point A to Point B faster, and he does his Ventures with USA Government Funding. What a Fu@kin joke. You People better wake up. EL ON is a master salesman and a golden boy for Future Seekers that want the latest gadgets for their garages. This is why he; sta, sta, sta, studders his words so much, because most of his words and prototypes will never come to fruition, and some are just lies. Last point: Why do I call him EL ON?

573.0,"Doomed to failure, and the animation does not even closely resemble the sewer pipe they drove the Tesla in a couple months back.
The number of vehicles able to traverse this system is limited to the number of skates. The number of skates is limited to the number of parking spaces collectively used. When you enter the system you have rely on a skate being present. When you exit the system, you have to pray there is no skate in the stall you want to leave through. If you have more skates in the system than parking spaces, it is theoretically possible to have all the spaces occupied and nowhere available to exit the system.
Musk's vapid comments about being able to ""drill down indefinitely to create levels upon levels of tunnels"" should also clue most people in to the fact that he has NO clue. How does your skate get to the third level or 12th level of tunnels without encountering the others above it, how do you get from one level to the next, how do those tunnels converge at the terminus? How do you extract cars that wreck, catch fire (as Teslas do). And how are you expected to travel at hundreds of mph when your Tesla has no such top speed? In the LA sewer tunnel prototype, the heavily modified Tesla used its own motor to traverse the tunnel, and at a minimal top speed to boot. 300mph?  Pfft!
Let's say the skates actually were able to do 300mph. The car's suspension is not built for that. How is the skate going to attach itself to the vehicle? Wheel hubs, perhaps? Well, THEY'RE not built for that acceleration/deceleration either. And the safety features/airbags/crumple zones are ALSO not built to withstand accidents at 300mph. Also, whiplash much?

 work troublesome because of traffic congestion.  So, his solution is to bore a tunnel beneath public land and Jetson the populous (mainly himself and his cohorts) to a chosen destination.  Government largesse has enabled Musk to develop his autocentric universe.  Now he decides that public land should be handed over as a bequest to his rather fantastic (in terms of surreal) so-called vision, without consulting the citizenry.  He is especially fond of fast-tracking, which illustrates his lack of wisdom.  There is absolutely no reason to construct the very restricted means of transport he is pushing.  As for Tesla, the large manufacturers, such as Volkswagen, Porsche and others will soon bury his not-so-successful auto adventure.

From a structural safety standpoint, the tunnel moves uniformly with the ground, in contrast to surface structures.  Additionally, a large amount of earthquake damage occurs from falling debris, which does not apply inside tunnels. Some examples:
    1994 Northridge Earthquake: no damage to LA Subway tunnels
    1989 Loma Prieta (Northern California) Earthquake: no damage to tunnels, which were then used to transport rescue personnel

Then the rail zaps them to their destination. But the cars still run on their regular tyres. Just that they don't control their speed and turns.Futuristic Solution: Electric car enters tunnel, controls get overridden, car speed set to Xkm/hr.

There would just be too much engineering involved, and end up being very expensive and too extension too manage. If there were lots of areas (but not nearly as many that the parking spot sized elevator would require) basically just the size of a medium sized parking lot where cars can get in line and pull into a slot on a sled and then take off together, maybe 5 per sled, I think it could work better.

Who needs ""mass transit"" and those silly things called ""subways"", you can't take your car on one, so its so stupid an idea!Seems like every genius engineer has to have a Spruce Goose - it might work, but, in the long run, its expensive, and unnecessary, as well as an episode of time when they strip naked and store their pee in a jar, which would be Elon Musk's obsession with the ideas that something which we may never see for another 200 years, but he is *sure* we will have magically breakthroughs over, any day now (never mind that we don't even have a clue how the F to find those breakthroughs), will somehow pit uploaded/neuralinked transhumans against a malignant child of Siri (presumably without both being reduced to ineffectual idiocy by our poor understanding of sentience, consciousness and actual function of critical bits of the brain's function).Its all well and good to dwell on the grand ideas, and possible risks, of freaking science fiction, but not to the bloody stupid extent that you make the same mistake past writers did, and start thinking that, ""2020 sounds like a good date to pick for when it will all happen."", or the even bloody worse nonsense of assuming that, just because you can imagine something, the ""end result"" will ""look like, and function exactly like"", what you are imagining. Hint: it never does, and sometime, fear, lack of openness in the design process, etc. make it so that, even if it was vaguely ""possible"" to get a result, it will either be supplanted by something else, with its own limitations and problems, or it will never, ever, result in the exact form you imagined. What ever bits of the silly nonsense Musk keeps rambling about that do happen, they will look **nothing at all** like what he, or any of the other squirrely, semi-paranoid, ""visionaries"" imagine it will, unless, ironically, someone 50-100 years after the ""real one"" comes along decides to create a ""retro"" version. A sort of ""Fallout game"" equivalent of, ""What if we actually had all those crazy breakthroughs back in 2020, when the world looked so backwards and had so many silly idea?""Much of the stuff he comes up with, like every generation of ""visionaries"", is silly and absurd, even to the people living in it. Because, again... WTF good is it to take the existing problem, i.e., lack of public transportation, and/or sensible solutions to move people around, and shove all that into single vehicle, underground, and overly bloody complicated, ""single car transporters, which, when things f up, will leave you stuck down there, or misqueue and shove your car up under someone else on the road up top (or possibly open the hole in front of the car already there, or.. Good design means, ""Fewer things that can go wrong."", not, ""Heh, I think Rube Goldberg had a great solution to our traffic problem, here is how I would implement it!!"" Yikes! And the cost of doing it the stupid way, instead of just... firing all the idiots that keep stealing money from things like California's transit system (which would, sadly, be most of the politicians in the state), and actually building a light rail system for people... Mind, just to be clear on this - this is proof that Democrats, while they may be pro-social issues, are still conservative/greed driven on every other subject, and thus **not actually progressives**. The idiots in charge in other cities, including mine, which is conservative run, and in Arizona, pull the same thing, on the same issues. They recently killed public transportation (because, well, when no one, because of how the city is laid out, in part, can ""get"" to the damn bus, its kind of silly to whine about there being no one riding them), but, while they where still trying to fund it, they had a small.. hickup. Seems, millions went ""missing"", which where supposed to be allocated to the project. They, surprisingly, ""found"" enough millions, misallocated to other projects, to fix this, but ""never"" managed to work out how, whoops!, it went missing in the first place. I mean, seriously? When they can't f-ing keep track of where money went/got spent in **either** Republican or Democrat run cities/states, is it any wonder why both sides have some completely delusional ideas about how the economy works, with the former thinking that it all ""fixes itself, via market forces"", while the latter seems to think it just grows on trees?
Sorry about that bit of rant, but.. seriously, you can't, ""Do what is needed to elevate people above the problems they can't solve themselves."", by ""hoping"" the money will magically appear when needed, instead of.. actually planning out how to spend it sensibly (the Democrat's problem), nor by just going, ""Well, gosh... we have no idea where it went, but those people are not trying hard enough to fix their own problems anyway, so why worry? The market will fix everything, and I have this spendy project that will help the market coming up, so I need to cut something from children's food programs to pay for it!"" (the Republican solution). Where the F are the people, who we can vote for, that believe in a) actual accounting for the money, and b) actually making sure the freaking solutions ""fix"" the actual problems, instead of just wishing they fix themselves, or praying the money will drop out of the sky, to fund something they don't actually pay enough attention to for them to know if its working, or not, or why not? And... then we get the people like Musk coming along with, ""I got a damn silly idea, but since I am a ""visionary"", you can really believe in it! Lets build it!"" Arghhh!!!!!!!",spam,negative,0,0

How much will you be charged for the tunnel? At $5 (a ridiculously high toll) per car per entrance, it would take 85 million cars to pay off a single tunnel.

The initial price of tunnel is probably off, but the concept stays the same.

I see a similar use here, a faster, safer, and more energy efficient alternative to interstate highways. It also has a leg up on air travel because once you arrive at your destination, you still have the comforts of your own vehicle to get around. In addition, it would be a great response to critics of Tesla vehicles who say that their range is an obstacle for travel over long distances because this could eliminate the need for constant refueling/recharging stops throughout the journey.

computer technology. The system in the video is going to require some 
kind of advanced supercomputer to handle merging, ingress and egress, 
etc...What's pictured doesn't solve traffic, it makes it worse. If 
everyone has to drive to get to the tunnel entrances you're going to be 
stuck in traffic waiting to get in and out.If tunneling is orders of magnitude cheaper, suddenly there can 
be a subway line within walking distance of everything important in an 
urban core, and you don't need  a car for the last mile 
problem. From an urban planning perspective, a car-free or car-lite 
streetscape is much healthier for pedestrians, and in turn better for 
retail economies in the urban core.I forgot the most important part. MAINTENANCE COSTS. A more
 complex system is going to break more and it's going to be harder to 
fix when it does break. What's more complex? The system in this video?

Simply set up an automated network of buses and cars that comes close to picking up people on request and taking them to their destination. It's not such a crazy idea if you think about it.

The automation of travel and communication between vehicles to improve traffic (at the level that traffic lights are no longer needed, for example, thus reducing travel time) is something that is already being done (and I think Tesla also works on something similar). After the success of services such as BlaBlaCar or Uber (leaving aside the nefarious news that the latter company raises) shows that society is prepared for it.

And by God, it will probably be so efficient that with 10% of the current traffic is enough to cover the displacement needs of the population.
