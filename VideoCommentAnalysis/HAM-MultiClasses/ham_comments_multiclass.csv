297,"This is something that is inevitable in Chicago. I’ve long thought that I-290 and parts of I-90 will either have to build tunnels or build elevated highways over existing ones. 
If you look at I-290 heading into downtown Chicago there is literally no room to expand the highway - each side has access roads and houses making expansion impossible. 
An elevated highway might be cheaper to build but would likely be more expensive to maintain - especially during the winter. Some kind of steam heating built underneath the road would be needed to stop snow accumulation.

  Surface real estate is finite. The earths population is and will continue to grow and the need for that finite real estate will compete among transportation, housing and agriculture.

. Tesla should build a tunnel ready vehicle with modified wheel hubs to ride on metal rails in the tunnels. Use a 3rd rail to power and recharge the Tesla battery while on the rails. Tesla computers would interface with the tunnel computers to maintain speed, safe distance, and merging to enter or exit the high speed transit rail.

573,"Doomed to failure, and the animation does not even closely resemble the sewer pipe they drove the Tesla in a couple months back.
The number of vehicles able to traverse this system is limited to the number of skates. The number of skates is limited to the number of parking spaces collectively used. When you enter the system you have rely on a skate being present. When you exit the system, you have to pray there is no skate in the stall you want to leave through. If you have more skates in the system than parking spaces, it is theoretically possible to have all the spaces occupied and nowhere available to exit the system.
Musk's vapid comments about being able to ""drill down indefinitely to create levels upon levels of tunnels"" should also clue most people in to the fact that he has NO clue. How does your skate get to the third level or 12th level of tunnels without encountering the others above it, how do you get from one level to the next, how do those tunnels converge at the terminus? How do you extract cars that wreck, catch fire (as Teslas do). And how are you expected to travel at hundreds of mph when your Tesla has no such top speed? In the LA sewer tunnel prototype, the heavily modified Tesla used its own motor to traverse the tunnel, and at a minimal top speed to boot. 300mph?  Pfft!
Let's say the skates actually were able to do 300mph. The car's suspension is not built for that. How is the skate going to attach itself to the vehicle? Wheel hubs, perhaps? Well, THEY'RE not built for that acceleration/deceleration either. And the safety features/airbags/crumple zones are ALSO not built to withstand accidents at 300mph. Also, whiplash much?
Just some of the things MuskRat never thought about before paying computer animators big bucks to separate you from your cash.

585,"Car elevators arn't needed. Simply use existing car garages in the city under buildings
 as entry/exit points by building extra ground floor for entering into tunells. Cars can travel from one garage to another through tunells at high speeds, freeing streets. Great idea. For higher speeds air should be pumped in the direction of traffic to reduce air friction. Besides little wheels reinforced bumpers should be added.

A better solution would be to keep the cars completely out of the city and transport only the people in and out. Either above ground or underground. Put them in groups in bigger vehicles and drive them to various locations. That can be very easy scheduled.

No need for the tunnel though. Just basically have a series of multiple rail road tracks headed each way with loading systems for vehicle wanting to use them.

What is proven to work is less cars on the road, more people on byclicles or scooters or walking for shorter distances.

Then the rail zaps them to their destination. But the cars still run on their regular tyres. Just that they don't control their speed and turns.Futuristic Solution: Electric car enters tunnel, controls get overridden, car speed set to Xkm/hr.

There would just be too much engineering involved, and end up being very expensive and too extension too manage. If there were lots of areas (but not nearly as many that the parking spot sized elevator would require) basically just the size of a medium sized parking lot where cars can get in line and pull into a slot on a sled and then take off together, maybe 5 per sled, I think it could work better.
